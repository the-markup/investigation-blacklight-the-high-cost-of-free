Transition was still just a far future concept due to the ban, the exclusion of women from direct combat roles, and family challenges.  Kara again pushed her identity to the background and consumed herself with the Army.<br><br>Over the years, the voice in her head proclaiming who she really was grew louder, and the consequences of coming out on a professional level had been greatly reduced with the implementation of open service. In 2018, the female voice in Kara’s head became the voice coming out of her mouth.  She told her pregnant wife that she needed to transition and planned to do so once her daughters were born, but her plans sped up in concern that her window was closing. She knew the new ban on transgender service put in place by the Trump administration would prevent her from coming out if she didn’t do it right away. Without transition, and the authenticity that goes with it, she feared there was no way to be an effective senior officer.  Kara questioned all of the things she would be willing to lose by coming out, but knew she had to take the risk.  She almost lost everything.<br><br>When Kara came out to her unit reactions were mixed and often born of ignorance, but her advantage was that her chain of command was in her corner.  They saw the soldier, not the gender.  The biggest blow occurred when her family left.  Kara was devastated and saw her life quickly shatter.  Depression settled in for a lengthy and unpleasant visit that took her to some very dark places. Trouble in her personal life spilled into her professional life and nearly forced her to leave the Army  she loved so dearly.  She credits her parents, close friends, a few transgender service members, and her dog for pushing her to hang on through the turmoil.  </p><p>A few months later Kara got the opportunity to see her family for a few days and discovered that she and her wife had refused to give up on one another, there was still love between them.   Kara also put on the service uniform fitting her gender, mentored a few junior female infantry lieutenants, and paid her first visit in a decade to a Catholic Mass.  Through these events, Kara found a renewed sense of purpose and of self.  She rededicated herself professionally and the support of her unit grew exponentially.  Leaders, peers, and outstanding non-commissioned officers put their names and reputations on the line for her, a transgender soldier, as she fought to regain what had once been such stable footing.</p><p>With regained support, Kara’s performance rebounded and her troubles dissipated.  In July 2019 she received orders to attend the prestigious Command and General Staff Officers Course and was promoted to the rank of Major.  She put her financial house in order, found normalcy in the life of a soldier-scholar, threw herself into a challenging fitness routine that led to completing her first marathon, and most importantly, reconnected with her family.  This past month, her family settled back in with her in Kansas where they happily raise their twin daughters.</p><p>Reunited with her family and re-energized about her future, MAJ Corcoran is serving as the senior-most female infantry officer in military. She aspires to set the example for combat arms women, be a transgender advocate, and to mentor those up, down, left and right of her.  She knows it was a narrow escape for her to make it to this time and place and said “When you’re in the deepest, darkest place, rarely does one make it out alone.” </p><p>The risk Kara took paid off.  Through transition, as challenging as it was, she found that better life that so many veterans sought by being their authentic selves. Kara counts her blessings that she gets to live it while proudly serving in the Army.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/11/75474179_2501945086519394_4215951275121967104_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment To Serve - Major Kara Corcoran"></figure><h2 id="q-a-with-kara-corcoran">Q &amp; A with Kara Corcoran</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> When did you join the military and why?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> To serve my country.  My parents taught us the values of honor, pride and patriotism.  Now the Army is a family business.

This fired me up even more.”<br><br>Over the next three months she completed a special project to re-invent the Company’s Information System Program, managing $1.5 Million worth of computers and radios.  Several people senior to her failed to achieve a needed security certification, but Adrianna got it and filled in as a higher privileged admin to ensure her unit accomplished its mission.  She gained her Commander’s respect and her program was rated “Best in Division”.<br><br>Adrianna was honorably discharged from the Army in 2018 and is now pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering at Oregon State University.  She said “I survived don’t ask don’t tell, I survived being trans while serving, and I did this with high merits and an honorable discharge. Being a veteran (now) means that I fulfilled the duty that I was called upon to do for this great nation.”</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/11/75199836_2479993182119185_7690377988482793472_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment To Serve - Staff Sergeant Adrianna Guevarra"></figure><h2 id="q-a-with-adrianna-guevarra">Q &amp; A with Adrianna Guevarra</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you stay resilient?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> In the face of adversity, I try to surround myself with a community that is filled with love and compassion.

She didn't even know that being transgender was something someone could be.  After joining the Air Force she went through several cycles where she’d buy a new feminine wardrobe and then throw it all away in shame.  After her last purge in 2018, she was badly hurting and it was affecting her job performance.  She broke down and decided to Google “How do you know if you're transgender?”<br><br>She watched video after video on YouTube hoping to spot the evidence that would tell her that she couldn’t possibly be transgender.  She didn’t find it and spent much of the night bawling as the reality of her situation unloaded itself on her.  Soon afterwards, she made an appointment with the base JAG (lawyer) to discuss what would happen if she came out, expecting to be told she’d lose her career.  To her surprise, the JAG told her that there really weren’t any negative consequences*.  Two months later, after medical evaluation, Aylanna began her transition.   <br><br>Aylanna was pleasantly surprised by the reaction of her fellow Airmen.  Recalling the early days she said “not only was everyone okay with me, but they were respectful and, unprompted, started calling me ma'am and gendering me properly!” She was treated like any other valued member of the team and even given some short notice, high priority, tasks to ensure aircraft were operating with the latest electronic countermeasures up and running.  Then came the move back to the US.  <br><br>After Aylanna’s redeployment from Korea back to the states, getting word about the Airman’s concerns was her first real bump of transition-related adversity. She kept her cool and probed for context, discovering what was going on with the rumor. She understood her Airmen may have been fearful of her because they heard she was giving out Letters of Reprimand to anyone who misgendered her. That was far from the truth.<br><br>Aylanna called the flight together at shift change and addressed everyone to dispel the rumor.  She covered the regulations that would have forbidden that action and explained that she would always respect them and never give them a reason to not respect her.  They had a common issue to devote their energy to: the mission.  The very next shift, the same airman that was so sure that caused the senior NCO to pull her aside greeted her saying "Excuse me, ma'am. I was wondering if you could help me with something that I don't understand."  From that point forward, it’s been smooth sailing as the entire flight works together to keep aircraft flying.</p><hr><p><strong>* Editor's Note:</strong> SSgt Anderson transitioned before the implementation of President Trump’s ban on transgender service members. Luckily, she’s considered “Exempt” and her stellar career can continue along with the other approximately 1,500 Exempt service members; however, the remaining 13,500 transgender service members could face discharge if they come out and need to transition.

I saw my life spiraling downward and, honestly, I probably would have ended up in prison by now if I hadn't walked into my local recruiter's office.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you stay resilient?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I'd have to say that my resilience comes from my philosophical approach. I don't demand respect, but I command it through my actions. I won't lie, sometimes I break down and reach out for help. But I find strength in other members of SPART*A who make time for me, in my other friends, and in the people that I meet through volunteer work around base. </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?</p><p><strong>A:</strong>Transgender is an adjective and not a noun. We don't define ourselves on the fact that we are transgender, but on the pride of purpose we put into our jobs. <br><br><strong>Q:</strong> How can people be a good ally?<br><br><strong>A: </strong>People can quash negative speaking about trans members. We aren't really different from anyone and all we want is for the norm to become acceptance. We know that there are negative opinions about everything, but a simple "That's not okay" to a negative comment is enough to stop that trend.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What does SPART*A mean to trans service members?<br><br><strong>A: </strong>We are here to help them and support them because this roadblock can't last forever. We are still fighting for their right to come out and feel complete as a person.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Commitment to Serve - Airman 1st Class Mason Rogers]]></title><description><![CDATA["Hey!

A guy? A girl?" Airman 1<sup>st</sup>Class Mason Rogers kept his head down and his mind calm as he let it wash right past him.  The calls kept coming.  "Hey! Are you a guy? Are you a girl? What are you?"  Similar incidents occurred all the time before he joined the Air Force, but this time was different.  His friends were with him and had his back.  <br><br>Mason had just completed basic training and was in technical school to become a security forces Airman.   The rules in tech school are slightly relaxed compared to basic and Mason had the opportunity to again wear civilian clothes off-duty.  His wardrobe was decidedly causal, distinctly male, and comfortably his own.  He had been living as a male for the year prior to joining the Air Force, but had to enlist under female standards.  His fellow students noticed, but they all just called each other by last names and they kept their questions to themselves… for a while.  When the questions began, Mason decided to tell them that he was transgender one at a time.  Each Airman told Mason that he had their full support.  Mason’s friendships paid off, because it was his fellow trainees that looked out for him when the cat-calls came.  They were at his side every step and made sure he was OK all the way through the course.  After graduation, Mason moved to his first duty station, Tinker Air Force Base, where he discovered that it wasn’t just his friends that were going to give him a hand. <br><br>Growing up, Mason had always wanted to be an Air Force cop, and he had just achieved that.  But now there was something more, it was time to be himself.  Expressing who he was only outside of duty hours wasn’t allowing Mason to grow and develop into the best Airman he could be, but he was scared.  He didn’t want to lose what he’d already achieved and the thought of transitioning warred with his desire to remain in the Air Force.  Luckily, it wasn’t an either/or decision.  6 months after his arrival at Tinker, Mason worked with his leadership to begin the process of an in-service transition.  As he prepared paperwork for his commander’s approval, he was shaking and wondering what would happen to him and his family, but he sent it forward.  <br><br>A few days later, Mason received approval to attend a week-long evaluation with Air Force medical personnel in San Antonio, but it had a note on it that made his heart race: his commander wanted to meet with him before and after the trip.  Mason feared the worst, but was about to find another ally.  In the meeting, Mason’s commander was attentive and asked questions that would help him understand the process that Mason was going to go through so that he could better help Mason get through it.  They covered a wide range of topics, including how Mason was fitting in and making a difference in the unit.  Leaving his office, Mason felt accomplished and comfortable.  Was it really going to be this easy?</p><p>Though Mason knew his leadership would back him up every step of the way, when he got word of the new ban going into place in April 2019 he rushed to complete as much of his transition as he could.  The fear that his dream could be taken away was back, but Mason wouldn’t let that stop him.  Since then, he’s worked with his unit to pull together an information repository in case there was another trans Airmen in the unit at some point.  Mason is also planning to start working on a degree this year and expects to spend at least 6 years on active duty prior to undertaking another transition, but this time just moving to the Guard or Reserve so that he can move to Washington State and continue his service.  </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/08/62432636_352075472135800_6220057215290572800_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Airman 1st Class Mason Rogers"><figcaption>A1C Rogers With His Wife In Oregon</figcaption></figure><h2 id="q-a-with-a1c-rogers">Q &amp; A with A1C Rogers</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did you join the military?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I joined in November of 2017. I had just finished my first year of college. I was going for a bachelors in homeland security &amp; terrorism but couldn't afford to go back for a second year so I decided to enlist. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are your career goals?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> My professional goal in the military is becoming a fully qualified security forces Airman.

In the face of whatever they were going through they remained strong and pushed forward. I also have a large amount of support. My family and friends have always been there. They can always be relied on when I need picked up. My support from leadership makes all the difference also. Going into work knowing I'm supported makes me feel proud and worthy of serving.

We are given standards and either meet or exceed them. We don't weaken the military. We provide support in every area. We are intel, medical, mechanics, security, and so on.

We all wear the same uniform and are held to the same standard.</p><p><strong> </strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[SPARTA announces new leadership]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today SPART*A, the nation’s leading transgender military service organization, announced Emma Shinn as the new Board Chair and President of the organization. ]]></description><link>https://spartapride.org/sparta-announces-new-leadership/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5d1b5b8386720604846d8416</guid><category><![CDATA[Press Releases]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kara Zajac]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 13:33:05 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/07/Emma-Shinn-1.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/07/Emma-Shinn-1.png" alt="SPARTA announces new leadership"><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today SPART*A, the nation’s leading transgender military service organization, announced Emma Shinn as the new Board Chair and President of the organization.  Emma has been on the Board of Directors since Dec 2018 and served as the Director of Community Relations.  She is a Captain in the Marine Corps and a Judge Advocate with prior experience as an enlisted infantry platoon sergeant.  Emma enlisted in 1994 and was temporarily retired from active duty in 2014. Her return to active duty is imminent and long awaited.  The previous president, Lieutenant Commander Blake Dremann will remain on the Board of Directors and serve as Treasurer of the organization.   </p><p> “On behalf of the nearly 1,000 members of SPART*A, I am honored to step into the very large shoes of Blake Dremann, who has served our Nation in uniform for over 13 years and as SPART*A Board Chair for nearly three years. Thank you, Blake, for your continued service!” stated Shinn.  She continued “I am excited and humbled to lead SPART*A.  Our members are the best of what our Nation has to offer: dedicated, capable, and qualified individuals. We ask nothing more than to serve our Nation as our authentic selves.”  </p><p>Serving through the tumultuous time between the announcement of open service, the presidential tweets, and the policy and court battles that led to a ban on transgender service being put back in place, LCDR Dremann kept a steady hand on the tiller of the organization.  Blake ensured the membership was well informed at all times while taking meaningful steps to educate the nation’s public and lawmakers on the value of transgender service, culminating in an appearance to testify in front of the House Armed Services Committee.    </p><p>As Dremann’s time at the head of SPART*A came to an end he stated that “It has been my honor to lead this amazing organization.

We stand ready, willing, and able to meet any challenge while protecting the rights of all transgender service members and their families.”  </p><p>Questions or requests for further information should be directed to inquiries@spartapride.org</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Commitment to Serve - Staff Sergeant Allyn Cropper]]></title><description><![CDATA[Deployed to Kuwait, Allyn discovered the term ‘transgender’.

Luckily, he had access to some online resources and came across the term ‘transgender’.  It was like a shock to the brain, he immediately identified with it as an answer to all the questions of “Why am I different?”  His Army journey had just begun, but so had his journey of identity. </p><p>When Allyn returned from Kuwait the excitement was palpable and he decided that he was going to change his middle name. He called his mother to talk to her about what he was going through and to hopefully get her input.  Unfortunately, the reaction was not what he expected or hoped for.  She was not at all pleased and told him that if  he changed his middle name he would need to change his last name as well. Allyn was badly stung, but he didn’t hold it against her or dissuade him from the path he knew to be right.  He had reached a point where he could not live in the gender he was assigned at birth; the stakes of not transitioning were too high.  </p><p>Mere months later, in the early stages of his transition, Allyn volunteered to go to South Korea because the mission mattered to him.   It turned out to be a fantastic opportunity where he felt so free. His fellow soldiers were focused on his work ethic and his eagerness to learn, not how he presented himself. While there, Allyn also focused on his relationship with his mother and it paid off. She realized that he was still the loving and caring child that she’s known all her life and is now his biggest supporter. </p><p>Allyn left Korea after two years and returned stateside to a base in Arizona where he experienced discrimination almost immediately. 2 years of struggle went by in a transphobic environment where it was the opposite of Korea: he was judged on who he was, not his performance.  It was a constant struggle and he had to fight for every school and every career opportunity he needed. He started to hate the Army that he had so loved. Luckily, in his third year, new leadership arrived and changed everything. Through their guidance, Allyn did not give up on himself or the Army. They saw his potential and challenged him every day to work past the previous discrimination. Though the Army still recognized Allyn as a female at the time, they used proper pronouns and created a culture of dignity and respect while ensuring Allyn was able to attend the training he needed to be eligible for promotion to Sergeant. </p><p>While at training, Allyn took the opportunity to address misconceptions about trans soldiers and gave a speech to his class. His voice cracked and tears ran down his face as he told them that he was transgender and that he didn’t want any special treatment, he simply wanted to serve. The support and love he received that day fills his heart now and forever.  To him, that day proved all the news stories about military members not accepting transgender Soldiers were lies.  His peers had his back. </p><p>In the years since, Allyn reenlisted, was promoted to Staff Sergeant and moved to Fort Eustis, VA. Though the era of open service has come and gone, his command has done everything possible to ensure equitable treatment. From day one, he was able to communicate any issues directly to them. SSG Cropper is glad he didn’t give up on the Army and that the Army hasn’t given up on him.  Though the ups and downs have been many, and he expects more, the military is his passion and he’s committed to seeing it through.  </p><p>Along the way, SSG Cropper has earned 3 Army Commendation medals, 4 Army Achievement medals, 3 Army Good Conduct medals, 4 Certificates of Achievements, Commandants list, Solider of the Quarter, and more.  Not a bad way to start a career.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/06/65853298_373207200066711_4814344844858097664_n-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Staff Sergeant Allyn Cropper"></figure><h2 id="q-a-with-ssg-cropper">Q &amp; A with SSG Cropper</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did you join the military?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I joined the military in September of 2008. I wanted a foundation in my life and I was not ready to attend college. It was also a family tradition so I figured, “why not?”</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are your career goals?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> My career goal is to retire as a Sergeant Major, the highest enlisted rank.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you stay resilient?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> My mother plays a major role in my resilience. On days that I don’t think I can make it I think of her and her life journey. I also use my mater resiliency skills I learned as an Army resiliency trainer.  When it’s all said and done we are all just humans experiencing life.  </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I think they would like to know that we don’t want any special treatment.  We took an oath just like everyone else and are expected to abide by it just like anyone else. Being transgender is a small part of who we are it’s not who we are. We are so much more than our transitions. </p><p><strong> Q:</strong> What can allies do to support the trans military community?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: The best thing an ally can do is learn how to be an informed ally and speak up when a trans person isn’t around. To me what determines is you are a true ally is what is done and said when I’m not around. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Key National LGBTQ Military Organizations Respond to

We will continue to fight until open and authentic military service is the law of the land – our service members deserve it and our country needs it.”</p><p>"We stand firmly with our members and the thousands of transgender troops serving bravely across the globe,” <strong>said SPARTA President Blake Dremann.</strong> “While the new policy may go into effect soon, it does not remove or lessen the contributions we continue to provide in the defense of our Nation.

SPART*A is thankful for the opportunity to showcase their patriotism, capabilities, contributions, and future potential.<br> <br>“The military is strongest when each of us is able to be our truest self” said SSG King. “I have seen first-hand how diverse, authentic teams are more cohesive and more productive. Each of us should be judged on the merits of our achievements, not based on who we are.”<br><br>LCDR Dremann said that “sharing his path and accomplishments with the committee, will show that transgender service members bring value to the military and contribute every day to the readiness and lethality of our country's military.”  He noted that “by codifying nondiscrimination, we focus on the capability of our service members. The military has long been on the forefront of inclusion without sacrificing any ability to accomplish the mission.”</p><p>According to HM3 Wyatt, “diversity is a basic characteristic of human society and transgender Americans are a reflection of that in our military.” She noted her desire to show transgender service members join and serve for the same reasons as everyone else.</p><p>CPT Stehlik notes that “in the increasingly complex operating environment, the Armed Forces need to recruit and retain the most qualified individuals possible. I am proud to be able to share why my continued service as a transgender woman, along with that of so many other trans people, increases the readiness of our Armed Services.”<br><br>CPT Peace said she’s “thankful for the opportunity to inform lawmakers about what transgender military service looks like from the perspective of a former company commander and career Soldier.”  She also expressed hope for the future, stating “the defense of our nation is strongest when we judge our service members based solely on performance and potential, and allow for all Americans who are qualified, capable, and willing to serve.”<br><br>Military history repeatedly demonstrates the value of including diverse groups. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. ended military discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, and, in 2016, gender identity. Each time, the newly-integrated group faced the same arguments transgender service members face today:  that they were a threat to unit cohesion, military readiness, lethality, and affordability. Time and again, the accusations proved unfounded and our military proved stronger. Transgender service members have demonstrated the current allegations are just as baseless and that open service adds value, increases effectiveness, and aids in mission accomplishment.<br><br>SPART*A appreciates this opportunity to showcase some of the best and brightest our military has to offer, who just happen to be transgender.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>For further information, please contact <a href="mailto:inquiries@spartapride.org">inquiries@spartapride.org</a>. <br><br>More information may be found at <a href="http://www.spartapride.org">www.spartapride.org</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Commitment to Serve - Senior Airman Sterling Crutcher]]></title><description><![CDATA[Twice deployed and a father-to-be, transgender Senior Airman Sterling Crutcher tells why he's so committed to the Air Force  ]]></description><link>https://spartapride.org/commitment-to-serve-senior-airman-sterling-crutcher/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c561a44a8d9a105ecf9fb06</guid><category><![CDATA[Commitment To Serve]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Bree Bryan Fram]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 Feb 2019 23:55:32 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/02/21083001_10213789636000569_7883314580584155238_o.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/02/21083001_10213789636000569_7883314580584155238_o.jpg" alt="Commitment to Serve - Senior Airman Sterling Crutcher"><p>Senior Airman Sterling Crutcher always had a desire to serve.  As he watched an older sibling sign up right out of high school, he knew that he’d end up in the military too.  Somewhere along the way, he let outside influences pull him off course and he ended up working odd jobs until he was 25 and was asked why he never followed his dream.  He didn’t have a good answer and a few days later he was speaking with a recruiter.<br><br>Sterling had been in the Air Force just a few months when he got tasked to deploy to Southwest Asia in 2016.  He fit right in and was having far and away the best experience of his career.  However, unbeknownst to his deployed peers, Sterling had begun the process of transitioning just before deployment and was still serving under female regulations as he worked towards meeting male standards.  He made sure his chain of command knew what was happening and received their warm support; they began immediately using male pronouns for him.   <br><br>A few months into the deployment, a senior military medical officer became aware that Sterling was transgender and ordered him sent stateside immediately.  His leadership was furious, telling Sterling over and over again what an asset he was, and couldn’t understand why they were losing this bright Airman that had done nothing but good for them.  His Squadron Commander fought for him to stay, but was unable to prevail.  Sterling was crushed; he was ashamed at being ordered home.  Even though it wasn’t his choice, he felt like he was abandoning his unit.  <br><br>Asleep in the passenger terminal waiting for his flight home, Sterling was awoken by his Chief telling him that the Commander had come to see him and was waiting outside.  Sterling popped right outside, came to attention, and saluted as he watched tears flow from his Commander’s eyes.  The Commander apologized to Sterling for everything that was happening, told him about all the wonderful things his supervisors had to say about him, and let him know that he hoped Sterling would get the chance to come back.  He reached his hand out to Sterling he said “Don’t be too hard yourself, it is not your fault.  If you ever need support, you have mine.”  As Sterling pulled his hand away, he found himself in possession of the Commander’s Coin, a tradition of recognizing excellent performance in the military.  At that moment, Sterling knew he would fight to continue serving no matter what stood in his way.<br><br>When Sterling returned home he was approached by a national news organization doing a story on transgender people in the military.  He was worried that he’d be prevented from participating by his home command, but the exact opposite was true.  They were just as impressed with Sterling as his deployed leadership had been and provided a Public Affairs officer to work with Sterling and help him prepare for the interview.  They helped Sterling approach the interview the right way and be sure of what he could say.  <br><br>After the interview aired, people on base were frequently walking up to him for a handshake and to let him know he had their support.  To Sterling those simple gestures were incredibly meaningful and kept him going on some of his darkest days.  They were constant reminders that he wasn’t alone in any of this.  The support also fueled him; because of it Sterling said “I work hard every day to prove that just because I am trans, it doesn’t make me any less an Airman.”<br><br>In 2018, serving openly and proudly, Senior Airman Crutcher deployed again. During an extremely successful 6 months where he was recognized as one of the most competent Crew Chiefs, he earned 3 more coins from his Group and Squadron Commanders.  In January 2019, Sterling returned home to his pregnant wife. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/02/49721859_10213645423310251_1805610869783003136_o.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Senior Airman Sterling Crutcher"><figcaption>SrA Crutcher's Post-Deployment Reunion With His Wife</figcaption></figure><h2 id="q-a-with-sra-crutcher">Q &amp; A with SrA Crutcher</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are your career goals?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I am striving to attain my Ph.D in Clinical Psychology and become an officer in the Psychology Field. I am applying to the Uniformed Services University, which is the military medical school. One of my recommendations actually comes from my own mental health physician who oversees my transition plan. He told “I would make a great asset and be of great help having gone through the process.” I am taking the GRE for med school and  am putting my ducks in a row to have my application in by the next deadline, Dec. 2019. My hope is to be able to help military members in all aspects and assist with those coming out and taking their transition journeys.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you stay resilient?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I would be lying if I said this was all easy. Coming out, facing discrimination and hate, and dealing with an unknown future is not at all easy. Every day is a conscious effort to keep going and keep fighting. I like to believe I have grown stronger as I work on myself. In 2018, I started reading books by Buddhist monks. These books helped me realize that I can live with my suffering and pain and use it to water my spiritual garden for the better. This has brought me into a mindful way of living. It has also helped me become a more loving and compassionate human being. Living mindfully has brought me to a place of peace in the face of adversity. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I feel there is a lot of stigma in being transgender in the military.  Almost as if they think we’re acting out to get attention, instead of seeing the person before them. People often say to me “You don’t look trans”.  It’s as if they expect to see me with long hair and feminine features in a male dress uniform. They often wonder if I am even able to meet standards or if it is harder for me to meet the standard. There is little understanding or caring about the individual. If I had to tell people one thing, it would be to focus on the individual and not the image society has thrust upon them.</p><p><strong> Q:</strong> What can allies do to support the trans military community?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: Continue to be a voice, and advocate for those who don’t have a voice for themselves. Be compassionate to be everyone, no matter what they say or believe. This is how you drive change. </p><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/02/49895718_1947292625577656_6908086043824619520_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Senior Airman Sterling Crutcher"><figcaption>Sterling Crutcher After Returning From His First Deployment</figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[To 2019!]]></title><description><![CDATA[A "Happy New Year 2019" message of thanks from all of us at SPART*A. ]]></description><link>https://spartapride.org/thank-you/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c298d8742549613f1456de2</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Bree Bryan Fram]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 13:50:42 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/12/Laila.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/308840585?app_id=122963" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" title="SPART*A Sends Thanks" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/12/Laila.jpg" alt="To 2019!"><p>SPART*A extends our sincere thanks to everyone that has been on this journey with us.  It's been two and a half years since we were allowed to serve openly, but our fates are still uncertain.  Since so many of you are watching out for us, supporting us, advocating for us, and educating on our behalf, we wanted to give back a bit even if it's just a simple "Thank You".<br><br>On behalf of SPART*A, thanks for being on our side and Happy New Year!  We're looking forward to health, happiness, and continued service in 2019.   </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Emma Shinn Joins SPART*A Board of Directors]]></title><description><![CDATA[SPARTA is thrilled to announce the addition of Emma Shinn to the Board of Directors.]]></description><link>https://spartapride.org/emma-shinn-joins-spart-a-board-of-directors/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c05a9d542549613f1456d77</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Bree Bryan Fram]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 22:38:23 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/12/47681887_382534299157683_1888040646632013824_n-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/12/47681887_382534299157683_1888040646632013824_n-1.jpg" alt="Emma Shinn Joins SPART*A Board of Directors"><p>WASHINGTON — SPARTA is thrilled to announce the addition of <a href="https://spartapride.org/emma-shinn/]]><![CDATA[">Emma Shinn</a> to the Board of Directors. Emma joins SPARTA as the Director of Community Relations and will work to build bridges with other civil rights focused organizations and individuals.  SPARTA understands the power of collective action and intersectional identities and is fully committed to supporting all who value our constitutional liberties and who work to expand opportunities for all individuals.</p>
<p>Emma Shinn is a Marine judge advocate and prior enlisted infantry platoon sergeant, enlisting in 1994 and temporarily retiring from active duty in 2014.

Perhaps it was portentous, because by the time he reached ‘Master-at-Arms’ A-school, Kris realized he was attracted to women which was a difficult pill for him to swallow.  Over his next few years Kris came to terms with his attraction, but Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was still in effect and he took his recruiter’s advice to heart because he loved his Navy life.<br><br>Kris excelled in his Navy career and earned am appointment to the Naval Academy. DADT was repealed during his plebe (freshman) year and took effect as his sophomore year began.  The relief was palpable, but Kris was still cautious.  Along with a group of friends, Kris founded the first LGBT relations club, Spectrum, at the Naval Academy. The club brought in guest speakers to educate people on a number of topics, including what it means to be transgender.  <br><br>Once again, what the outside world saw didn’t line up with Kris’ internal thoughts. During his junior year, his fiancé at the time asked him if he thought he might be trans.  He had to think about it for a bit, but it started to click.  Maybe that was it and the recruiter had been wrong all along… he was straight after all, he just happened to be male.<br><br>It was 2013 and Kris took the next year to figure out how he was going to handle coming out as trans, because open service wasn’t yet on the horizon.  He came out to his roommate, close friends, and immediate family just before graduation in 2014 but knew the time wasn’t right to come out to the Navy.  He decided not to pursue transition until he had established a strong reputation on his ship so he spent his first year as a Surface Warfare Officer learning his role and working on his qualifications.  It paid off.  In August of 2015 he came out to his doctor and his commanding officer (CO) which was followed by an announcement to the ship’s officers.  Kris recounts the conversation as follows:      </p><p>*Edited for brevity<br>CO: And now First has something to say.</p><p>Kris: &lt;extremely nervous, ringing his hands, bright red and noticeably sweating&gt; “When I say transgender, does everyone know what that means?”</p><p>CO: They don’t live under a rock, get on with it.</p><p>Kris: &lt;said with voice and hands shaking&gt; OK, so I’m transgender. I identify as a male but was born female. I began hormone therapy this last week to assist with my transition. I just wanted to get everyone together to get it out in the open. Everyone will begin to see and hear changes very soon and I’d rather be upfront then have a bunch of rumors or confusion going around amongst the wardroom, mess, and Sailors. Any questions for me?” </p><p>*dead silence for a few moments*</p><p>Chief Engineer: Are you happy?</p><p>Me: Yes.</p><p>Chief Engineer: Then who cares what anyone else has to say?<br><br>Almost all of the officers in the room shook his hand, patted him on the back, and some even gave him a hug.  Kris was shocked, relieved, and almost in tears with surprise as to how well it had gone.  Not only did Kris never have a single issue with anyone on the ship, his performance continued to speak for itself and was recognized by a follow-on assignment back to the Naval Academy to teach leadership and be responsible for over 150 midshipmen.  Kris remains in awe of the support his was shown by his community on the ship, but he remains concerned that his experience isn’t always the case for others.  Kris says “We’re Navy (Army, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guardsmen) first.  Why should it matter if we’re trans?”<br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/11/bio-photo-cropped.png" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Lieutenant Kris Moore"><figcaption>Lt Moore's Official Navy Photo</figcaption></figure><h2 id="q-a-with-lt-moore"><br>Q &amp; A with LT Moore</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> When did you join the military and why?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> In 2004 I graduated high school in Boise, ID and began hanging out with a crowd with very little motivation.  I realized that I was quickly falling in line with their irresponsible behavior so, as we were out shopping one day, I asked my parents to go with me to the recruiting stations. My folks were EXTREMELY happy to oblige and we hopped in the car right away. I joined the military in 2005, at 18, to create a better life for myself and to serve my country. I desired access to free education and a steady career where I could learn about myself and the world.  <br><br>I remember wanting to join the military since I was in the second grade, back then I wanted to be a fighter pilot (thank you Top Gun and the Discovery Channel Carrier series) but I lost motivation somewhere in high school. But I believe that there is such thing as a true calling in life and the Navy is exactly that for me.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are your career goals?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Ideally, I wish to serve 20+ years and command a warship at sea. If I can stay in longer that would be great, but I don’t really know what my goals are beyond command at sea. I want to continue to grow as a leader so I can provide the best guidance and training to my Sailors. I enjoy education so on my shore rotations I hope to continue to teach classes at the Naval Academy, ROTC units, training and education commands, or something similar. I’m also very interested in mentorship so I try to help other service members with their careers by giving advice or resources, coaching them through situations they are in, and just showing that I support them through their struggles. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you stay resilient?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I stay resilient by focusing on the task at hand and reevaluating my goals or mission. In regards to overcoming adversity related to being transgender, I like to think about how far we’ve come, the thousands of other current service members that need each and every one of us to succeed, and the countless ones yet to come. And, not that I’m a stoic at all, but I find solace in one of the principles of stoicism—basically, worry doesn’t get you anywhere, focus on the things you can change, and let go of the things you can’t. If we look at the big picture, we often see that we can’t change it by ourselves, so I try to dig deep and figure out a small thing I can work on and try to help the situation that way.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The most important thing for people to understand about transgender service members is that we (for the most part) identify as Sailors, Marines, Airmen, Soldiers, or Coast Guardsmen first… we just happen to be trans. I can’t speak for everyone, but I want to be judged based on my work ethic and leadership, not on how I identify. I want to spend my energy doing my job to the best of my ability, taking care of my Sailors, and ensuring my ship is battle-ready at all times; I don’t want to waste energy worrying about my job security.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/11/43314838_10161036365845224_6980573538319073280_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Lieutenant Kris Moore"></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Commitment to Serve - Technical Sergeant Katherine Caldwell]]></title><description><![CDATA[TSgt Katherine Caldwell is committed to  the Air Force.

The issue ended right there.  Summing up the situation, Katherine said “With good leaders that set expectations, we can focus on the mission rather than letting people's biases get in the way.”  <br><br>Katherine loves what she done during her 17 years in the Air Force.  She’s a specialist in Radio Frequency communications currently assigned to the headquarters of Air Combat Command on Langley Air Force Base.   Working on the headquarters staff gives her an outsized impact on the future operations of the Air Force.  She recently ran an Air Force working group to plan the modernization of HF radios that will enhance the resilience of airborne networks.  The output of her group will develop communications techniques and technologies to help ensure that when the Air Force operates in contested environments it can dominate in the frequency spectrum domain.  With her mind focused on the future, Katherine says “I spend a lot more time thinking about the mission than the fact that I am transgender.”</p><p>Looking at her performance reports, the first 13 years of TSgt Caldwell’s career reflect outstanding achievement, but she felt a weight around her neck that served to hold her back somewhat.  She felt a need to control people’s perception of her so as to not give away who she really was.  Lose control for even a moment and that constant risk of losing her career, a risk that had nothing whatsoever to do with her performance, could be realized.  Since the policy changed, Katherine has been able to be herself at work and the only perception she has to worry about know is the evaluation of her renewed spirit and focus on the mission.  <br><br>With less than three years to retirement, Katherine is hearing the call of a family that has been through a lot.  Her kids have handled a number of moves with her, including three countries, and she’s looking for some stability.  It hasn’t been all bad though, one of her fondest memories is the hike she did to the top of Mt. Fuji in Japan.  She’s passed that love of the outdoors onto her kids and they recently completed a nine-mile hike. When retirement from the Air Force does finally come, she hopes to have a bit more time to focus on her guitar, outdoor sports, and volunteering.   Until then, she’s committed to giving the Air Force everything she’s got.  She said “I love that I can do this (work) in an environment where my gender and status as a transgender person doesn't get in the way while working on the requirements and solutions to support the warfighter!”  </p><p>Just as her Deputy Division Chief set the expectations that allowed Katherine to flourish, Katherine now sets the expectations for future tactics and technology that will allow the Air Force to fly, fight, and win across warfighting domains.  No bias will get in the way of that.   </p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/10/43708894_267501407440699_5092263777626226688_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Technical Sergeant Katherine Caldwell"><figcaption>TSgt Caldwell hiking in the Shenadoah National Park</figcaption></figure><h1 id="q-a-with-tsgt-caldwell"><strong>Q &amp; A with TSgt Caldwell</strong></h1><p><strong>Q:</strong> When did you join the military and why?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I joined in October 2001. When I graduated highschool I didn't really know what to do. My grades were mediocre and the apeal of doing something more interesting than working an entry level service job was really appealing. I nearly joined the Army because I really wanted to fly helecopters, but the apeal of the Air Force won me over and I joined what was Satellite Wideband and Telemetry Communications at the time. I was in the delayed enlistment program when September 11th happened. At the time I remember thinking that it looked like I would have some work worth doing ahead of me.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are your career goals?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I will spend the next three years being the best NCO I can be. Once I get out I plan on working in business in a way that lets me continue to have a positive impact. Right now I am working on my MBA in IT management with WGU. Outside of the military I see how businesses can make a large impact on people and our nation. I wanted to learn the business skills to augment what I have learned in the military. Working with the companies that help us keep our technologies at the cutting edge really helped me learn what some of those possibilities could be.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you stay resilient?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> This has been a challenge for me. I was really afraid when I first started and that fear ate at me more than anything. One day I put a trans pride sticker on my truck as a way to put myself out there and I found that it really helped. That is when I learned that for me, the best way to face fear is to walk up to the thing I am afraid of and stand my ground. Now I almost get a kick out of facing my fears. I used to hate rollercoasters and heights, so I went skydiving a couple years ago. </p><p>One of the things I do is that when I have a challenge that seems impossible I just try to identify any action that will take me one step towards defeating the adversity and I work on taking it while trying not to stress about the larger problem.  If I just keep fighting in the right direction, I tend to get where I want to be; even if it wasn't where I thought I wanted to go originally!</p><p>When I have particularly bad days I will spend more time with my music or take my bike onto some of the more intense trails in the area.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> This is simpler than people seem to be making it. Transition is relatively simple medically, legally and socially compared to how it has been treated from my experience. Give me quick straightforward access to care and transition related processes and let me get back to my job. This might just be my opinion, but we are here serving, we don't want this to be a giant issue and we just want to be ourselves so we can focus on our mission. Transgender service ideally should have been a quiet easy thing with little bureaucracy, but due to cultural realities it has been a fight. These realities have also made the current processes much more bureaucratic than needed. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What can allies do to support the trans military community?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I think one of the most powerful things allies can do for transgender service members and transgender people in general is to help normalize trans people within society.  Allies can help our culture shift to one where people don't think much hearing about or seeing trans people. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/10/43695508_575901552840630_9149200206510686208_n-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Technical Sergeant Katherine Caldwell"><figcaption>TSgt Caldwell at the Joint Women's Leadership Symposium</figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[SPART*A Statement on Proposed Transgender Policy Changes]]></title><description><![CDATA[SPART*A believes that the best determinant of someone’s gender is that person and that the federal government should continue to respect the freedom of individuals to live authentically.]]></description><link>https://spartapride.org/spart-a-statement-on-proposed-transgender-policy-changes/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bd1218642549613f1456d16</guid><category><![CDATA[Press Releases]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Bree Bryan Fram]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2018 01:57:43 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/10/Sparta_logo.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/10/Sparta_logo.png" alt="SPART*A Statement on Proposed Transgender Policy Changes"><p>SPART*A strongly opposes the proposed policy changes by the federal government that conflates sex and gender and seeks to redefine sex as immutable and defined by genetics at birth.  According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html?fbclid=IwAR17bLTZkEo-0f0HiA5l9orn6T1-Lfgot24KkGwLeLhGnc3qKyUlrsll70E">New York Times</a>, the Department of Health and Human Services is proposing a rule that “Sex means a person’s status as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth,” and that “The sex listed on a person’s birth certificate, as originally issued, shall constitute definitive proof of a person’s sex unless rebutted by reliable genetic evidence.”<br><br>SPART*A shares the view of the Times that the proposed changes “ would essentially eradicate federal recognition of the estimated 1.4 million Americans who have opted to recognize themselves — surgically or otherwise — as a gender other than the one they were born into.”  </p><p>SPART*A believes that the best determinant of someone’s gender is that person and that the federal government should continue to respect the freedom of individuals to live authentically.  “We stand with ALL transgender and non-binary people as they continue to live as their authentic selves. We remain resolute in our commitment to protect this country no matter how anyone attempts to make us disappear” says Blake Dremman, president of SPART*A.</p><p>Transgender people will always be with us and will not be erased by federal rule changes.  Regardless of the policy, or proposed changes, the transgender members of SPART*A remain committed to their oath to defend the Constitution of the United States and to gladly give of themselves to ensure its freedoms are equally enjoyed by all Americans.  </p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss></div><div class="header"><span>This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it.

she neither left the Army nor was forced out to transition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a young age, Kara had the feeling that something wasn’t right with her body, but everything society had to say told her it was just as it should be.  It wasn’t until exploration on the internet while attending Norwich University that she learned transgender people exist.  She was in the Corps of Cadets at the time and though the notion of being trans struck a chord with her, it wasn’t anything she could countenance at the time.  She fought it, overcompensated, and threw herself into the profession of arms.  She earned a reputation as an alpha male, someone who was dominant, impulsive, and ruthless.  Still, her drive for success, skill with tactics, and high fitness level earned her a commission into the infantry.  Shortly after, she met her future wife, graduated ranger school, and led a platoon through a very eventful deployment to Afghanistan.  Through it all the chance to live as her authentic self was speaking to her from the back of her mind, but the risk to career and profession was too much to listen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year after returning from Afghanistan, Kara began to explore her gender identity and began living a double life due to the ban on being trans in the military at the time.  On the occasional weekend Kara could be herself, but on duty she was the same successful male Army infantry officer she had always been. Transition was still just a far future concept due to the ban, the exclusion of women from direct combat roles, and family challenges.  Kara again pushed her identity to the background and consumed herself with the Army.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the years, the voice in her head proclaiming who she really was grew louder, and the consequences of coming out on a professional level had been greatly reduced with the implementation of open service. In 2018, the female voice in Kara’s head became the voice coming out of her mouth.  She told her pregnant wife that she needed to transition and planned to do so once her daughters were born, but her plans sped up in concern that her window was closing. She knew the new ban on transgender service put in place by the Trump administration would prevent her from coming out if she didn’t do it right away. Without transition, and the authenticity that goes with it, she feared there was no way to be an effective senior officer.  Kara questioned all of the things she would be willing to lose by coming out, but knew she had to take the risk.  She almost lost everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kara came out to her unit reactions were mixed and often born of ignorance, but her advantage was that her chain of command was in her corner.  They saw the soldier, not the gender.  The biggest blow occurred when her family left.  Kara was devastated and saw her life quickly shatter.  Depression settled in for a lengthy and unpleasant visit that took her to some very dark places. Trouble in her personal life spilled into her professional life and nearly forced her to leave the Army  she loved so dearly.  She credits her parents, close friends, a few transgender service members, and her dog for pushing her to hang on through the turmoil.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months later Kara got the opportunity to see her family for a few days and discovered that she and her wife had refused to give up on one another, there was still love between them.   Kara also put on the service uniform fitting her gender, mentored a few junior female infantry lieutenants, and paid her first visit in a decade to a Catholic Mass.  Through these events, Kara found a renewed sense of purpose and of self.  She rededicated herself professionally and the support of her unit grew exponentially.  Leaders, peers, and outstanding non-commissioned officers put their names and reputations on the line for her, a transgender soldier, as she fought to regain what had once been such stable footing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regained support, Kara’s performance rebounded and her troubles dissipated.  In July 2019 she received orders to attend the prestigious Command and General Staff Officers Course and was promoted to the rank of Major.  She put her financial house in order, found normalcy in the life of a soldier-scholar, threw herself into a challenging fitness routine that led to completing her first marathon, and most importantly, reconnected with her family.  This past month, her family settled back in with her in Kansas where they happily raise their twin daughters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reunited with her family and re-energized about her future, MAJ Corcoran is serving as the senior-most female infantry officer in military. She aspires to set the example for combat arms women, be a transgender advocate, and to mentor those up, down, left and right of her.  She knows it was a narrow escape for her to make it to this time and place and said “When you’re in the deepest, darkest place, rarely does one make it out alone.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk Kara took paid off.  Through transition, as challenging as it was, she found that better life that so many veterans sought by being their authentic selves. Kara counts her blessings that she gets to live it while proudly serving in the Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/11/75474179_2501945086519394_4215951275121967104_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment To Serve - Major Kara Corcoran"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-a-with-kara-corcoran"&gt;Q &amp;amp; A with Kara Corcoran&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; When did you join the military and why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; To serve my country.  My parents taught us the values of honor, pride and patriotism.  Now the Army is a family business. I graduated from Corps of Cadets at Norwich University, VT with a Civil Engineering degree and commissioned as an Infantry Officer in May of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are your career goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;My #1 Goal is to be an Airborne Infantry Battalion Commander and then retire.  Post Army, my aspirations are to work in Emergency Management.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you stay resilient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Positivity, Purpose, and People.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; First and foremost, judge someone by their character, competency, and commitment.  Do not judge by color, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or gender.  We are all human.  Judge us based off our actions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also know that transition is difficult.  Physical, Mental, Emotional, and Spiritual health are all interconnected.  Please understand that when a service member transitions they are filling massive void in their health.  I cannot begin to describe how much more productive they are after transition.  We are all over the world, deployed, and within your ranks.  We serve to serve.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, start with the "Golden Rule" but end with the "Platinum Rule," treat others as they wish to be treated.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How can people be a good ally?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Stick up for us and take care of us as if we were your brother, sister, mother, father, son, or daughter.  We are a family.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Anything else you want people to know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Stay Airborne! Follow Me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/11/77343801_734050863737725_3982600595214172160_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment To Serve - Major Kara Corcoran"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</span></div><div class="line"><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/content:encoded&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;content:encoded&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/content:encoded&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/item&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;item&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/item&gt;</span></div></div></div><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible14"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;item&gt;</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible15"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;title&gt;</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible16"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><span class="text">Commitment To Serve - Staff Sergeant Adrianna Guevarra</span></div><div class="line"><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/title&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;title&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/title&gt;</span></div></div></div><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible17"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;description&gt;</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible18"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><span class="text">I survived DADT and being trans while serving, and did it with high merit.

Staff Sergeant Adrianna Guevarra"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homeless in Lawton, Oklahoma at the age of 14, Adrianna Guevara needed a way out.  It would be several more years before she could join, but she knew the military offered a stability she hadn’t known.  She said that joining the Army gave her “…a roof over my head, food in my stomach, a stable paycheck, a way to pay for college, and a way for me to strengthen my character.”  Once in, she was a quick study and rose through the ranks rapidly, reaching Staff Sergeant (E-6) as a Signal Support Systems Specialist in only 5 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently promoted to Sergeant, Adrianna was sent to Schofield Barracks in Hawaii and attached to a brand new company in the Field Artillery unit as a Senior Information Non-Commissioned Officer.  It was a position well above her grade, but she had confidence she could do it.   For the first two years, she did just that and built a strong record of performance in her unit.  Little did she know a problem lurked in in the Company rumor mill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like most transgender people in the military, Adrianna served in silence before 2016 and protected her identity even while taking every opportunity she could to express herself as the person she truly was.  Somehow, a Platoon Sergeant in her Company got a hold of a picture of her presenting herself as a woman and spread the picture throughout the organization without telling her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced the end of the ban on trans service, Adriana was ready to come out and begin a transition.  First, she had to tell her command even though she was scared of what might happen to her military career.  She started by requesting a meeting with her First Sergeant and told him everything.  Surprising to her, he was unsurprised.  He told her that he already knew because of the picture that had been floating around.  Adrianna was not only embarrassed, she felt betrayed.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though nervous about confronting the offending Platoon Sergeant because of their rank difference, Adrianna summoned the courage to speak with him.  To her surprise, he apologized and stated that he really hadn’t thought it was an issue, but the damage had been done.  Adrianna’s ability to influence the narrative about her had been lost. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adrianna spent the remaining two years of her military service working hard to repair the damage to her reputation through her commitment to the mission.  During her transition she went to see a therapist on a regular basis to take care of her mental health, but would always ensure her work was complete ahead of those visits.  Despite that, her Commander counseled her on his perception that she was asking to be treated like a ‘special case’.  Adriana stated “I did everything so that I wouldn’t get special treatment. This fired me up even more.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the next three months she completed a special project to re-invent the Company’s Information System Program, managing $1.5 Million worth of computers and radios.  Several people senior to her failed to achieve a needed security certification, but Adrianna got it and filled in as a higher privileged admin to ensure her unit accomplished its mission.  She gained her Commander’s respect and her program was rated “Best in Division”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adrianna was honorably discharged from the Army in 2018 and is now pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering at Oregon State University.  She said “I survived don’t ask don’t tell, I survived being trans while serving, and I did this with high merits and an honorable discharge. Being a veteran (now) means that I fulfilled the duty that I was called upon to do for this great nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/11/75199836_2479993182119185_7690377988482793472_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment To Serve - Staff Sergeant Adrianna Guevarra"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-a-with-adrianna-guevarra"&gt;Q &amp;amp; A with Adrianna Guevarra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you stay resilient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; In the face of adversity, I try to surround myself with a community that is filled with love and compassion. I talk with these people and I get to vent with these people, which allow me to organically express my frustrations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to let people know that transgender members of the military should not be judged externally but be judged on their merit and their character. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How can people be a good ally?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;I think the best way that allies can show support to the trans military community is by echoing our voices when we are not able to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What's your passion?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;I have a passion for Software Engineering and one day I hope that I can develop Software that will help SPART*A and the rest of the trans community all over the world. &lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div class="line"><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/content:encoded&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;content:encoded&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/content:encoded&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/item&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;item&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/item&gt;</span></div></div></div><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible24"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;item&gt;</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible25"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;title&gt;</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible26"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><span class="text">Thinking about doing research on transgender military service?</span></div><div class="line"><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/title&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;title&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/title&gt;</span></div></div></div><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible27"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;description&gt;</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible28"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><span class="text">SPART*A welcomes partnerships with researchers seeking to increase scientific knowledge about the lives of transgender service members.

However, we ask that researchers be mindful of transgender affirmative research practices and ethical considerations when conducting research with marginalized populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We encourage researchers to engage the transgender community as active collaborators in the production of knowledge about transgender bodies and experiences. The recommended best practice is to partner with communities and experts in LGBTQ+ affirming research early in the study design process. It is much more difficult to incorporate community feedback after you have already submitted for IRB approval.

Anderson"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumor spread like wildfire about Staff Sergeant Aylanna Anderson.  She was the crusading Non-Commissioned Officer handing out formal reprimands and derogatory paperwork like cheap Halloween candy.  She’d lash out at any Airman who looked at her strangely, mentioned her looks, or made a snide comment… or so the story went.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An Avionics Electronic Warfare Technician, Aylanna had recently moved from Kunsan Airbase in Korea to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, and the fact that she was transgender wasn’t the only thing that made the move with her.  Unfortunately, someone she regarded highly in Korea had started spreading vicious and false stories about her and she had no idea it was occurring.  The matter came to a head when she was pulled aside by her team lead to discuss an Airman she would be supervising.  The airman had told the team lead that he didn't "believe in transgenders" and didn't want his "Christian upbringing to clash with [her] 'lifestyle choice'" and that he thought she was going to "unfairly single him out" because "she’s one of those people you see on YouTube". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was interesting that the Airman brought up YouTube, because that was a big part of Aylanna coming to terms with who she was.  Aylanna grew up with dreams where she was a girl, but could never place why that was one of the few things that made her happy. She didn't even know that being transgender was something someone could be.  After joining the Air Force she went through several cycles where she’d buy a new feminine wardrobe and then throw it all away in shame.  After her last purge in 2018, she was badly hurting and it was affecting her job performance.  She broke down and decided to Google “How do you know if you're transgender?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She watched video after video on YouTube hoping to spot the evidence that would tell her that she couldn’t possibly be transgender.  She didn’t find it and spent much of the night bawling as the reality of her situation unloaded itself on her.  Soon afterwards, she made an appointment with the base JAG (lawyer) to discuss what would happen if she came out, expecting to be told she’d lose her career.  To her surprise, the JAG told her that there really weren’t any negative consequences*.  Two months later, after medical evaluation, Aylanna began her transition.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aylanna was pleasantly surprised by the reaction of her fellow Airmen.  Recalling the early days she said “not only was everyone okay with me, but they were respectful and, unprompted, started calling me ma'am and gendering me properly!” She was treated like any other valued member of the team and even given some short notice, high priority, tasks to ensure aircraft were operating with the latest electronic countermeasures up and running.  Then came the move back to the US.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Aylanna’s redeployment from Korea back to the states, getting word about the Airman’s concerns was her first real bump of transition-related adversity. She kept her cool and probed for context, discovering what was going on with the rumor. She understood her Airmen may have been fearful of her because they heard she was giving out Letters of Reprimand to anyone who misgendered her. That was far from the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aylanna called the flight together at shift change and addressed everyone to dispel the rumor.  She covered the regulations that would have forbidden that action and explained that she would always respect them and never give them a reason to not respect her.  They had a common issue to devote their energy to: the mission.  The very next shift, the same airman that was so sure that caused the senior NCO to pull her aside greeted her saying "Excuse me, ma'am. I was wondering if you could help me with something that I don't understand."  From that point forward, it’s been smooth sailing as the entire flight works together to keep aircraft flying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Editor's Note:&lt;/strong&gt; SSgt Anderson transitioned before the implementation of President Trump’s ban on transgender service members. Luckily, she’s considered “Exempt” and her stellar career can continue along with the other approximately 1,500 Exempt service members; however, the remaining 13,500 transgender service members could face discharge if they come out and need to transition. If you are currently-serving or considering joining the U.S. military and are transgender, please contact us at inquiries@spartapride.org prior to coming out so we can help you navigate the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/09/70012267_1288419631329512_8026149344749027328_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment To Serve - Staff Sergeant Aylanna Anderson"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-a-with-ssgt-anderson"&gt;Q &amp;amp; A with SSgt Anderson&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why did you join the military?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I shipped out to basic training the day after Thanksgiving in 2012. I saw my life spiraling downward and, honestly, I probably would have ended up in prison by now if I hadn't walked into my local recruiter's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you stay resilient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I'd have to say that my resilience comes from my philosophical approach. I don't demand respect, but I command it through my actions. I won't lie, sometimes I break down and reach out for help. But I find strength in other members of SPART*A who make time for me, in my other friends, and in the people that I meet through volunteer work around base. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt;Transgender is an adjective and not a noun. We don't define ourselves on the fact that we are transgender, but on the pride of purpose we put into our jobs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How can people be a good ally?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;People can quash negative speaking about trans members. We aren't really different from anyone and all we want is for the norm to become acceptance. We know that there are negative opinions about everything, but a simple "That's not okay" to a negative comment is enough to stop that trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What does SPART*A mean to trans service members?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;We are here to help them and support them because this roadblock can't last forever. We are still fighting for their right to come out and feel complete as a person.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div class="line"><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/content:encoded&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;content:encoded&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/content:encoded&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/item&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;item&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/item&gt;</span></div></div></div><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible44"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;item&gt;</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible45"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;title&gt;</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible46"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><span class="text">Commitment to Serve - Airman 1st Class Mason Rogers</span></div><div class="line"><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/title&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;title&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/title&gt;</span></div></div></div><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible47"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;description&gt;</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible48"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><span class="text">"Hey!

A guy? A girl?" Airman 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;Class Mason Rogers kept his head down and his mind calm as he let it wash right past him.  The calls kept coming.  "Hey! Are you a guy? Are you a girl? What are you?"  Similar incidents occurred all the time before he joined the Air Force, but this time was different.  His friends were with him and had his back.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mason had just completed basic training and was in technical school to become a security forces Airman.   The rules in tech school are slightly relaxed compared to basic and Mason had the opportunity to again wear civilian clothes off-duty.  His wardrobe was decidedly causal, distinctly male, and comfortably his own.  He had been living as a male for the year prior to joining the Air Force, but had to enlist under female standards.  His fellow students noticed, but they all just called each other by last names and they kept their questions to themselves… for a while.  When the questions began, Mason decided to tell them that he was transgender one at a time.  Each Airman told Mason that he had their full support.  Mason’s friendships paid off, because it was his fellow trainees that looked out for him when the cat-calls came.  They were at his side every step and made sure he was OK all the way through the course.  After graduation, Mason moved to his first duty station, Tinker Air Force Base, where he discovered that it wasn’t just his friends that were going to give him a hand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up, Mason had always wanted to be an Air Force cop, and he had just achieved that.  But now there was something more, it was time to be himself.  Expressing who he was only outside of duty hours wasn’t allowing Mason to grow and develop into the best Airman he could be, but he was scared.  He didn’t want to lose what he’d already achieved and the thought of transitioning warred with his desire to remain in the Air Force.  Luckily, it wasn’t an either/or decision.  6 months after his arrival at Tinker, Mason worked with his leadership to begin the process of an in-service transition.  As he prepared paperwork for his commander’s approval, he was shaking and wondering what would happen to him and his family, but he sent it forward.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few days later, Mason received approval to attend a week-long evaluation with Air Force medical personnel in San Antonio, but it had a note on it that made his heart race: his commander wanted to meet with him before and after the trip.  Mason feared the worst, but was about to find another ally.  In the meeting, Mason’s commander was attentive and asked questions that would help him understand the process that Mason was going to go through so that he could better help Mason get through it.  They covered a wide range of topics, including how Mason was fitting in and making a difference in the unit.  Leaving his office, Mason felt accomplished and comfortable.  Was it really going to be this easy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Mason knew his leadership would back him up every step of the way, when he got word of the new ban going into place in April 2019 he rushed to complete as much of his transition as he could.  The fear that his dream could be taken away was back, but Mason wouldn’t let that stop him.  Since then, he’s worked with his unit to pull together an information repository in case there was another trans Airmen in the unit at some point.  Mason is also planning to start working on a degree this year and expects to spend at least 6 years on active duty prior to undertaking another transition, but this time just moving to the Guard or Reserve so that he can move to Washington State and continue his service.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/08/62432636_352075472135800_6220057215290572800_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Airman 1st Class Mason Rogers"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A1C Rogers With His Wife In Oregon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-a-with-a1c-rogers"&gt;Q &amp;amp; A with A1C Rogers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why did you join the military?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I joined in November of 2017. I had just finished my first year of college. I was going for a bachelors in homeland security &amp;amp; terrorism but couldn't afford to go back for a second year so I decided to enlist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are your career goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; My professional goal in the military is becoming a fully qualified security forces Airman. I'm also on track to start my Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree this year.  After finishing CCAF, I hope to finish my bachelors in homeland security. Eventually, I hope to start a career with border patrol/customs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you stay resilient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I look back on the hardships that many communities have faced and look to them for additional strength. In the face of whatever they were going through they remained strong and pushed forward. I also have a large amount of support. My family and friends have always been there. They can always be relied on when I need picked up. My support from leadership makes all the difference also. Going into work knowing I'm supported makes me feel proud and worthy of serving. They all give me strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Transgender members of the military are capable. We are given standards and either meet or exceed them. We don't weaken the military. We provide support in every area. We are intel, medical, mechanics, security, and so on. Being transgender doesn't play a role in what I do for my job. We all wear the same uniform and are held to the same standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div class="line"><span

alt="SPARTA announces new leadership"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today SPART*A, the nation’s leading transgender military service organization, announced Emma Shinn as the new Board Chair and President of the organization.  Emma has been on the Board of Directors since Dec 2018 and served as the Director of Community Relations.  She is a Captain in the Marine Corps and a Judge Advocate with prior experience as an enlisted infantry platoon sergeant.  Emma enlisted in 1994 and was temporarily retired from active duty in 2014. Her return to active duty is imminent and long awaited.  The previous president, Lieutenant Commander Blake Dremann will remain on the Board of Directors and serve as Treasurer of the organization.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “On behalf of the nearly 1,000 members of SPART*A, I am honored to step into the very large shoes of Blake Dremann, who has served our Nation in uniform for over 13 years and as SPART*A Board Chair for nearly three years. Thank you, Blake, for your continued service!” stated Shinn.  She continued “I am excited and humbled to lead SPART*A.  Our members are the best of what our Nation has to offer: dedicated, capable, and qualified individuals. We ask nothing more than to serve our Nation as our authentic selves.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serving through the tumultuous time between the announcement of open service, the presidential tweets, and the policy and court battles that led to a ban on transgender service being put back in place, LCDR Dremann kept a steady hand on the tiller of the organization.  Blake ensured the membership was well informed at all times while taking meaningful steps to educate the nation’s public and lawmakers on the value of transgender service, culminating in an appearance to testify in front of the House Armed Services Committee.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dremann’s time at the head of SPART*A came to an end he stated that “It has been my honor to lead this amazing organization. I have full confidence that Emma will take the reins and continue to lead the fight for open transgender service taking the organization to the next level.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about her goals, Shinn remarked “SPART*A remains committed to demonstrating that open trans service is a force multiplier which adds to military readiness, morale, and unit cohesion.

Luckily, he had access to some online resources and came across the term ‘transgender’.  It was like a shock to the brain, he immediately identified with it as an answer to all the questions of “Why am I different?”  His Army journey had just begun, but so had his journey of identity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Allyn returned from Kuwait the excitement was palpable and he decided that he was going to change his middle name. He called his mother to talk to her about what he was going through and to hopefully get her input.  Unfortunately, the reaction was not what he expected or hoped for.  She was not at all pleased and told him that if  he changed his middle name he would need to change his last name as well. Allyn was badly stung, but he didn’t hold it against her or dissuade him from the path he knew to be right.  He had reached a point where he could not live in the gender he was assigned at birth; the stakes of not transitioning were too high.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mere months later, in the early stages of his transition, Allyn volunteered to go to South Korea because the mission mattered to him.   It turned out to be a fantastic opportunity where he felt so free. His fellow soldiers were focused on his work ethic and his eagerness to learn, not how he presented himself. While there, Allyn also focused on his relationship with his mother and it paid off. She realized that he was still the loving and caring child that she’s known all her life and is now his biggest supporter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allyn left Korea after two years and returned stateside to a base in Arizona where he experienced discrimination almost immediately. 2 years of struggle went by in a transphobic environment where it was the opposite of Korea: he was judged on who he was, not his performance.  It was a constant struggle and he had to fight for every school and every career opportunity he needed. He started to hate the Army that he had so loved. Luckily, in his third year, new leadership arrived and changed everything. Through their guidance, Allyn did not give up on himself or the Army. They saw his potential and challenged him every day to work past the previous discrimination. Though the Army still recognized Allyn as a female at the time, they used proper pronouns and created a culture of dignity and respect while ensuring Allyn was able to attend the training he needed to be eligible for promotion to Sergeant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While at training, Allyn took the opportunity to address misconceptions about trans soldiers and gave a speech to his class. His voice cracked and tears ran down his face as he told them that he was transgender and that he didn’t want any special treatment, he simply wanted to serve. The support and love he received that day fills his heart now and forever.  To him, that day proved all the news stories about military members not accepting transgender Soldiers were lies.  His peers had his back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years since, Allyn reenlisted, was promoted to Staff Sergeant and moved to Fort Eustis, VA. Though the era of open service has come and gone, his command has done everything possible to ensure equitable treatment. From day one, he was able to communicate any issues directly to them. SSG Cropper is glad he didn’t give up on the Army and that the Army hasn’t given up on him.  Though the ups and downs have been many, and he expects more, the military is his passion and he’s committed to seeing it through.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, SSG Cropper has earned 3 Army Commendation medals, 4 Army Achievement medals, 3 Army Good Conduct medals, 4 Certificates of Achievements, Commandants list, Solider of the Quarter, and more.  Not a bad way to start a career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/06/65853298_373207200066711_4814344844858097664_n-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Staff Sergeant Allyn Cropper"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-a-with-ssg-cropper"&gt;Q &amp;amp; A with SSG Cropper&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why did you join the military?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I joined the military in September of 2008. I wanted a foundation in my life and I was not ready to attend college. It was also a family tradition so I figured, “why not?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are your career goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; My career goal is to retire as a Sergeant Major, the highest enlisted rank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you stay resilient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; My mother plays a major role in my resilience. On days that I don’t think I can make it I think of her and her life journey. I also use my mater resiliency skills I learned as an Army resiliency trainer.  When it’s all said and done we are all just humans experiencing life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I think they would like to know that we don’t want any special treatment.  We took an oath just like everyone else and are expected to abide by it just like anyone else. Being transgender is a small part of who we are it’s not who we are. We are so much more than our transitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What can allies do to support the trans military community?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: The best thing an ally can do is learn how to be an informed ally and speak up when a trans person isn’t around. To me what determines is you are a true ally is what is done and said when I’m not around. &lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div class="line"><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/content:encoded&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;content:encoded&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/content:encoded&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/item&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;item&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/item&gt;</span></div></div></div><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible72"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;item&gt;</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible73"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;title&gt;</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><div class="collapsible" id="collapsible74"><div class="expanded"><div class="line"><span class="button collapse-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span></div><div class="collapsible-content"><span class="text">Key National LGBTQ Military Organizations Respond to

Administration’s Implementation of Ban on Open Trans Military Service"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the Administration took steps to implement its ban on open transgender military service. Implementation processes noted in the directive will officially go into effect in thirty days, just under three years after the current policy, allowing open transgender military service, was implemented. All &lt;a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/04/24/all-4-service-chiefs-on-record-no-harm-to-unit-from-transgender-service/"&gt;four service chiefs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.palmcenter.org/41-retired-generals-and-admirals-call-trump-transgender-ban-an-abuse-of-military-judgment/"&gt;41 retired Generals and Admirals&lt;/a&gt; have emphatically denounced the claims this Administration is using to justify the ban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OutServe-SLDN, SPARTA, and the American Military Partner Association (AMPA), the nation’s three key advocacy and support organizations for our LGBTQ military, veteran, and military family communities, issued the following responses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By taking steps to implement its ban on open and authentic military service, the Trump-Pence Administration has definitively affirmed that when it comes to our national security, they hold unsubstantiated and discriminatory claims as more important than effectively and efficiently completing the mission,”&lt;strong&gt; said OutServe-SLDN Executive Director Andy Blevins.&lt;/strong&gt; “Our transgender siblings-in-arms and future warriors have proven time and again that they are committed, that they are ready, and that they are able to selflessly and effectively serve our nation. We will continue to fight until open and authentic military service is the law of the land – our service members deserve it and our country needs it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We stand firmly with our members and the thousands of transgender troops serving bravely across the globe,” &lt;strong&gt;said SPARTA President Blake Dremann.&lt;/strong&gt; “While the new policy may go into effect soon, it does not remove or lessen the contributions we continue to provide in the defense of our Nation. We look forward to a time when service members are judged solely on their capability to complete the mission. We will continue to work to make that a reality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the start of an incredibly dark chapter in our nation’s history as the Trump-Pence Administration moves to implement an unconscionable ban on our brave transgender service members and qualified recruits who want to serve,” &lt;strong&gt;said American Military Partner Association (AMPA) President Ashley Broadway-Mack. &lt;/strong&gt;“This horrific policy is even more cruel than ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ because the Pentagon explicitly told these service members it was finally safe to come out — and now they are being targeted for discrimination. We emphatically condemn this unconscionable transgender military ban because it undermines military readiness, destroys unit cohesion, betrays our service members and is based on nothing more than blatant bigotry."&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div class="line"><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span

alt="SPART*A Members To Testify Before House Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee on Feb 27th"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, D.C., February 24th — Five courageous transgender U.S. service members will testify Wednesday before the Personnel Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee.  SPART*A President, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Blake Dremann, along with SPART*A members U.S. Army Captain Jennifer Peace, Army Captain Alivia Stehlik, Army Staff Sergeant Patricia King, and Navy Hospital Corpsman Third Class Akira Wyatt will represent thousands of transgender military members currently serving around the world. SPART*A is thankful for the opportunity to showcase their patriotism, capabilities, contributions, and future potential.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The military is strongest when each of us is able to be our truest self” said SSG King. “I have seen first-hand how diverse, authentic teams are more cohesive and more productive. Each of us should be judged on the merits of our achievements, not based on who we are.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LCDR Dremann said that “sharing his path and accomplishments with the committee, will show that transgender service members bring value to the military and contribute every day to the readiness and lethality of our country's military.”  He noted that “by codifying nondiscrimination, we focus on the capability of our service members. The military has long been on the forefront of inclusion without sacrificing any ability to accomplish the mission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to HM3 Wyatt, “diversity is a basic characteristic of human society and transgender Americans are a reflection of that in our military.” She noted her desire to show transgender service members join and serve for the same reasons as everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPT Stehlik notes that “in the increasingly complex operating environment, the Armed Forces need to recruit and retain the most qualified individuals possible. I am proud to be able to share why my continued service as a transgender woman, along with that of so many other trans people, increases the readiness of our Armed Services.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CPT Peace said she’s “thankful for the opportunity to inform lawmakers about what transgender military service looks like from the perspective of a former company commander and career Soldier.”  She also expressed hope for the future, stating “the defense of our nation is strongest when we judge our service members based solely on performance and potential, and allow for all Americans who are qualified, capable, and willing to serve.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Military history repeatedly demonstrates the value of including diverse groups. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. ended military discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, and, in 2016, gender identity. Each time, the newly-integrated group faced the same arguments transgender service members face today:  that they were a threat to unit cohesion, military readiness, lethality, and affordability. Time and again, the accusations proved unfounded and our military proved stronger. Transgender service members have demonstrated the current allegations are just as baseless and that open service adds value, increases effectiveness, and aids in mission accomplishment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SPART*A appreciates this opportunity to showcase some of the best and brightest our military has to offer, who just happen to be transgender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;For further information, please contact &lt;a

Crutcher"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Airman Sterling Crutcher always had a desire to serve.  As he watched an older sibling sign up right out of high school, he knew that he’d end up in the military too.  Somewhere along the way, he let outside influences pull him off course and he ended up working odd jobs until he was 25 and was asked why he never followed his dream.  He didn’t have a good answer and a few days later he was speaking with a recruiter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sterling had been in the Air Force just a few months when he got tasked to deploy to Southwest Asia in 2016.  He fit right in and was having far and away the best experience of his career.  However, unbeknownst to his deployed peers, Sterling had begun the process of transitioning just before deployment and was still serving under female regulations as he worked towards meeting male standards.  He made sure his chain of command knew what was happening and received their warm support; they began immediately using male pronouns for him.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few months into the deployment, a senior military medical officer became aware that Sterling was transgender and ordered him sent stateside immediately.  His leadership was furious, telling Sterling over and over again what an asset he was, and couldn’t understand why they were losing this bright Airman that had done nothing but good for them.  His Squadron Commander fought for him to stay, but was unable to prevail.  Sterling was crushed; he was ashamed at being ordered home.  Even though it wasn’t his choice, he felt like he was abandoning his unit.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asleep in the passenger terminal waiting for his flight home, Sterling was awoken by his Chief telling him that the Commander had come to see him and was waiting outside.  Sterling popped right outside, came to attention, and saluted as he watched tears flow from his Commander’s eyes.  The Commander apologized to Sterling for everything that was happening, told him about all the wonderful things his supervisors had to say about him, and let him know that he hoped Sterling would get the chance to come back.  He reached his hand out to Sterling he said “Don’t be too hard yourself, it is not your fault.  If you ever need support, you have mine.”  As Sterling pulled his hand away, he found himself in possession of the Commander’s Coin, a tradition of recognizing excellent performance in the military.  At that moment, Sterling knew he would fight to continue serving no matter what stood in his way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sterling returned home he was approached by a national news organization doing a story on transgender people in the military.  He was worried that he’d be prevented from participating by his home command, but the exact opposite was true.  They were just as impressed with Sterling as his deployed leadership had been and provided a Public Affairs officer to work with Sterling and help him prepare for the interview.  They helped Sterling approach the interview the right way and be sure of what he could say.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the interview aired, people on base were frequently walking up to him for a handshake and to let him know he had their support.  To Sterling those simple gestures were incredibly meaningful and kept him going on some of his darkest days.  They were constant reminders that he wasn’t alone in any of this.  The support also fueled him; because of it Sterling said “I work hard every day to prove that just because I am trans, it doesn’t make me any less an Airman.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2018, serving openly and proudly, Senior Airman Crutcher deployed again. During an extremely successful 6 months where he was recognized as one of the most competent Crew Chiefs, he earned 3 more coins from his Group and Squadron Commanders.  In January 2019, Sterling returned home to his pregnant wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2019/02/49721859_10213645423310251_1805610869783003136_o.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Senior Airman Sterling Crutcher"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;SrA Crutcher's Post-Deployment Reunion With His Wife&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-a-with-sra-crutcher"&gt;Q &amp;amp; A with SrA Crutcher&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are your career goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I am striving to attain my Ph.D in Clinical Psychology and become an officer in the Psychology Field. I am applying to the Uniformed Services University, which is the military medical school. One of my recommendations actually comes from my own mental health physician who oversees my transition plan. He told “I would make a great asset and be of great help having gone through the process.” I am taking the GRE for med school and  am putting my ducks in a row to have my application in by the next deadline, Dec. 2019. My hope is to be able to help military members in all aspects and assist with those coming out and taking their transition journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you stay resilient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I would be lying if I said this was all easy. Coming out, facing discrimination and hate, and dealing with an unknown future is not at all easy. Every day is a conscious effort to keep going and keep fighting. I like to believe I have grown stronger as I work on myself. In 2018, I started reading books by Buddhist monks. These books helped me realize that I can live with my suffering and pain and use it to water my spiritual garden for the better. This has brought me into a mindful way of living. It has also helped me become a more loving and compassionate human being. Living mindfully has brought me to a place of peace in the face of adversity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I feel there is a lot of stigma in being transgender in the military.  Almost as if they think we’re acting out to get attention, instead of seeing the person before them. People often say to me “You don’t look trans”.  It’s as if they expect to see me with long hair and feminine features in a male dress uniform. They often wonder if I am even able to meet standards or if it is harder for me to meet the standard. There is little understanding or caring about the individual. If I had to tell people one thing, it would be to focus on the individual and not the image society has thrust upon them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What can allies do to support the trans military community?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: Continue to be a voice, and advocate for those who don’t have a voice for themselves. Be compassionate to be everyone, no matter what they say or believe. This is how you drive change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img

Emma joins SPARTA as the Director of Community Relations and will work to build bridges with other civil rights focused organizations and individuals.  SPARTA understands the power of collective action and intersectional identities and is fully committed to supporting all who value our constitutional liberties and who work to expand opportunities for all individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma Shinn is a Marine judge advocate and prior enlisted infantry platoon sergeant, enlisting in 1994 and temporarily retiring from active duty in 2014. She is preparing to go back on active duty, but for the past four years, she ran her own criminal defense practice, Shinn Law Office, LLC, representing service members and civilians in state and federal courts in Colorado and military courts across the globe.  She is a zealous advocate for defending our Constitution and individual liberties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am beyond excited to be a member of SPARTA’s Board of Directors and work with veteran service organizations and others to achieve full inclusion in our Nation’s services for trans service members&amp;quot; said Shinn.  She recalls stepping on the yellow footprints at Marine Corps boot camp in 1994 and had no idea the path that lay ahead for her. She says &amp;quot;Since that decisive day, it has been my distinct honor to be both an Enlisted Infantry Marine and Officer of Marines all over the globe in peacetime and direct combat. No less than six times over my career, I’ve sworn a sacred oath to protect our Nation against all enemies. I continue to live by that oath every day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Lieutenant Kris Moore"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe there was something about Navy Lieutenant Kris Moore that was more obvious to the outside world than it ever was to him.  When Kris joined the Navy, his recruiter told him over and over again not to admit that he was gay.  It seemed odd to Kris because he didn’t identify as a homosexual, so why was this person so adamant that he not tell anyone.  Since it was still the era of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell (DADT), Kris wondered if this was boilerplate messaging from the recruiters to prevent them from losing one of their folks, but it seemed like more than that. Perhaps it was portentous, because by the time he reached ‘Master-at-Arms’ A-school, Kris realized he was attracted to women which was a difficult pill for him to swallow.  Over his next few years Kris came to terms with his attraction, but Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was still in effect and he took his recruiter’s advice to heart because he loved his Navy life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kris excelled in his Navy career and earned am appointment to the Naval Academy. DADT was repealed during his plebe (freshman) year and took effect as his sophomore year began.  The relief was palpable, but Kris was still cautious.  Along with a group of friends, Kris founded the first LGBT relations club, Spectrum, at the Naval Academy. The club brought in guest speakers to educate people on a number of topics, including what it means to be transgender.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once again, what the outside world saw didn’t line up with Kris’ internal thoughts. During his junior year, his fiancé at the time asked him if he thought he might be trans.  He had to think about it for a bit, but it started to click.  Maybe that was it and the recruiter had been wrong all along… he was straight after all, he just happened to be male.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was 2013 and Kris took the next year to figure out how he was going to handle coming out as trans, because open service wasn’t yet on the horizon.  He came out to his roommate, close friends, and immediate family just before graduation in 2014 but knew the time wasn’t right to come out to the Navy.  He decided not to pursue transition until he had established a strong reputation on his ship so he spent his first year as a Surface Warfare Officer learning his role and working on his qualifications.  It paid off.  In August of 2015 he came out to his doctor and his commanding officer (CO) which was followed by an announcement to the ship’s officers.  Kris recounts the conversation as follows:      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Edited for brevity&lt;br&gt;CO: And now First has something to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kris: &amp;lt;extremely nervous, ringing his hands, bright red and noticeably sweating&amp;gt; “When I say transgender, does everyone know what that means?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CO: They don’t live under a rock, get on with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kris: &amp;lt;said with voice and hands shaking&amp;gt; OK, so I’m transgender. I identify as a male but was born female. I began hormone therapy this last week to assist with my transition. I just wanted to get everyone together to get it out in the open. Everyone will begin to see and hear changes very soon and I’d rather be upfront then have a bunch of rumors or confusion going around amongst the wardroom, mess, and Sailors. Any questions for me?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*dead silence for a few moments*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Engineer: Are you happy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Engineer: Then who cares what anyone else has to say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost all of the officers in the room shook his hand, patted him on the back, and some even gave him a hug.  Kris was shocked, relieved, and almost in tears with surprise as to how well it had gone.  Not only did Kris never have a single issue with anyone on the ship, his performance continued to speak for itself and was recognized by a follow-on assignment back to the Naval Academy to teach leadership and be responsible for over 150 midshipmen.  Kris remains in awe of the support his was shown by his community on the ship, but he remains concerned that his experience isn’t always the case for others.  Kris says “We’re Navy (Army, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guardsmen) first.  Why should it matter if we’re trans?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/11/bio-photo-cropped.png" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Lieutenant Kris Moore"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lt Moore's Official Navy Photo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-a-with-lt-moore"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Q &amp;amp; A with LT Moore&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; When did you join the military and why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2004 I graduated high school in Boise, ID and began hanging out with a crowd with very little motivation.  I realized that I was quickly falling in line with their irresponsible behavior so, as we were out shopping one day, I asked my parents to go with me to the recruiting stations. My folks were EXTREMELY happy to oblige and we hopped in the car right away. I joined the military in 2005, at 18, to create a better life for myself and to serve my country. I desired access to free education and a steady career where I could learn about myself and the world.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember wanting to join the military since I was in the second grade, back then I wanted to be a fighter pilot (thank you Top Gun and the Discovery Channel Carrier series) but I lost motivation somewhere in high school. But I believe that there is such thing as a true calling in life and the Navy is exactly that for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are your career goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Ideally, I wish to serve 20+ years and command a warship at sea. If I can stay in longer that would be great, but I don’t really know what my goals are beyond command at sea. I want to continue to grow as a leader so I can provide the best guidance and training to my Sailors. I enjoy education so on my shore rotations I hope to continue to teach classes at the Naval Academy, ROTC units, training and education commands, or something similar. I’m also very interested in mentorship so I try to help other service members with their careers by giving advice or resources, coaching them through situations they are in, and just showing that I support them through their struggles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you stay resilient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I stay resilient by focusing on the task at hand and reevaluating my goals or mission. In regards to overcoming adversity related to being transgender, I like to think about how far we’ve come, the thousands of other current service members that need each and every one of us to succeed, and the countless ones yet to come. And, not that I’m a stoic at all, but I find solace in one of the principles of stoicism—basically, worry doesn’t get you anywhere, focus on the things you can change, and let go of the things you can’t. If we look at the big picture, we often see that we can’t change it by ourselves, so I try to dig deep and figure out a small thing I can work on and try to help the situation that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The most important thing for people to understand about transgender service members is that we (for the most part) identify as Sailors, Marines, Airmen, Soldiers, or Coast Guardsmen first… we just happen to be trans. I can’t speak for everyone, but I want to be judged based on my work ethic and leadership, not on how I identify.

The issue ended right there.  Summing up the situation, Katherine said “With good leaders that set expectations, we can focus on the mission rather than letting people's biases get in the way.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katherine loves what she done during her 17 years in the Air Force.  She’s a specialist in Radio Frequency communications currently assigned to the headquarters of Air Combat Command on Langley Air Force Base.   Working on the headquarters staff gives her an outsized impact on the future operations of the Air Force.  She recently ran an Air Force working group to plan the modernization of HF radios that will enhance the resilience of airborne networks.  The output of her group will develop communications techniques and technologies to help ensure that when the Air Force operates in contested environments it can dominate in the frequency spectrum domain.  With her mind focused on the future, Katherine says “I spend a lot more time thinking about the mission than the fact that I am transgender.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at her performance reports, the first 13 years of TSgt Caldwell’s career reflect outstanding achievement, but she felt a weight around her neck that served to hold her back somewhat.  She felt a need to control people’s perception of her so as to not give away who she really was.  Lose control for even a moment and that constant risk of losing her career, a risk that had nothing whatsoever to do with her performance, could be realized.  Since the policy changed, Katherine has been able to be herself at work and the only perception she has to worry about know is the evaluation of her renewed spirit and focus on the mission.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With less than three years to retirement, Katherine is hearing the call of a family that has been through a lot.  Her kids have handled a number of moves with her, including three countries, and she’s looking for some stability.  It hasn’t been all bad though, one of her fondest memories is the hike she did to the top of Mt. Fuji in Japan.  She’s passed that love of the outdoors onto her kids and they recently completed a nine-mile hike. When retirement from the Air Force does finally come, she hopes to have a bit more time to focus on her guitar, outdoor sports, and volunteering.   Until then, she’s committed to giving the Air Force everything she’s got.  She said “I love that I can do this (work) in an environment where my gender and status as a transgender person doesn't get in the way while working on the requirements and solutions to support the warfighter!”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as her Deputy Division Chief set the expectations that allowed Katherine to flourish, Katherine now sets the expectations for future tactics and technology that will allow the Air Force to fly, fight, and win across warfighting domains.  No bias will get in the way of that.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/10/43708894_267501407440699_5092263777626226688_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Commitment to Serve - Technical Sergeant Katherine Caldwell"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;TSgt Caldwell hiking in the Shenadoah National Park&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h1 id="q-a-with-tsgt-caldwell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q &amp;amp; A with TSgt Caldwell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; When did you join the military and why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I joined in October 2001. When I graduated highschool I didn't really know what to do. My grades were mediocre and the apeal of doing something more interesting than working an entry level service job was really appealing. I nearly joined the Army because I really wanted to fly helecopters, but the apeal of the Air Force won me over and I joined what was Satellite Wideband and Telemetry Communications at the time. I was in the delayed enlistment program when September 11th happened. At the time I remember thinking that it looked like I would have some work worth doing ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are your career goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I will spend the next three years being the best NCO I can be. Once I get out I plan on working in business in a way that lets me continue to have a positive impact. Right now I am working on my MBA in IT management with WGU. Outside of the military I see how businesses can make a large impact on people and our nation. I wanted to learn the business skills to augment what I have learned in the military. Working with the companies that help us keep our technologies at the cutting edge really helped me learn what some of those possibilities could be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you stay resilient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; This has been a challenge for me. I was really afraid when I first started and that fear ate at me more than anything. One day I put a trans pride sticker on my truck as a way to put myself out there and I found that it really helped. That is when I learned that for me, the best way to face fear is to walk up to the thing I am afraid of and stand my ground. Now I almost get a kick out of facing my fears. I used to hate rollercoasters and heights, so I went skydiving a couple years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things I do is that when I have a challenge that seems impossible I just try to identify any action that will take me one step towards defeating the adversity and I work on taking it while trying not to stress about the larger problem.  If I just keep fighting in the right direction, I tend to get where I want to be; even if it wasn't where I thought I wanted to go originally!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I have particularly bad days I will spend more time with my music or take my bike onto some of the more intense trails in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you want people to know about transgender members of the military?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; This is simpler than people seem to be making it. Transition is relatively simple medically, legally and socially compared to how it has been treated from my experience. Give me quick straightforward access to care and transition related processes and let me get back to my job. This might just be my opinion, but we are here serving, we don't want this to be a giant issue and we just want to be ourselves so we can focus on our mission. Transgender service ideally should have been a quiet easy thing with little bureaucracy, but due to cultural realities it has been a fight. These realities have also made the current processes much more bureaucratic than needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What can allies do to support the trans military community?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I think one of the most powerful things allies can do for transgender service members and transgender people in general is to help normalize trans people within society.  Allies can help our culture shift to one where people don't think much hearing about or seeing trans people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card

src="https://spartapride.org/content/images/2018/10/Sparta_logo.png" alt="SPART*A Statement on Proposed Transgender Policy Changes"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPART*A strongly opposes the proposed policy changes by the federal government that conflates sex and gender and seeks to redefine sex as immutable and defined by genetics at birth.  According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html?fbclid=IwAR17bLTZkEo-0f0HiA5l9orn6T1-Lfgot24KkGwLeLhGnc3qKyUlrsll70E"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the Department of Health and Human Services is proposing a rule that “Sex means a person’s status as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth,” and that “The sex listed on a person’s birth certificate, as originally issued, shall constitute definitive proof of a person’s sex unless rebutted by reliable genetic evidence.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SPART*A shares the view of the Times that the proposed changes “ would essentially eradicate federal recognition of the estimated 1.4 million Americans who have opted to recognize themselves — surgically or otherwise — as a gender other than the one they were born into.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPART*A believes that the best determinant of someone’s gender is that person and that the federal government should continue to respect the freedom of individuals to live authentically.  “We stand with ALL transgender and non-binary people as they continue to live as their authentic selves. We remain resolute in our commitment to protect this country no matter how anyone attempts to make us disappear” says Blake Dremman, president of SPART*A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transgender people will always be with us and will not be erased by federal rule changes.  Regardless of the policy, or proposed changes, the transgender members of SPART*A remain committed to their oath to defend the Constitution of the United States and to gladly give of themselves to ensure its freedoms are equally enjoyed by all Americans.  &lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div class="line"><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="text">&lt;![CDATA[</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="text">]]&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/content:encoded&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;content:encoded&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/content:encoded&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/item&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;item&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/item&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/channel&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;channel&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/channel&gt;</span></div></div></div></div><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/rss&gt;</span></div></div><div class="collapsed hidden"><div class="line"><span class="button expand-button"></span><span class="html-tag">&lt;rss<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">xmlns:dc</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">xmlns:content</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">xmlns:atom</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">xmlns:media</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">version</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">2.0</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span class="text">...</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/rss&gt;</span></div></div></div></div></body></html>
